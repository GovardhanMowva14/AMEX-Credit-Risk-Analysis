Credit Risk Prediction - American Express Default Dataset
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting credit defaults using the American Express Default Prediction dataset.
The objective is to develop a robust model that accurately identifies high-risk customers while maximizing revenue and maintaining control over default rates.

Key Highlights
Data Processing:
Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and dataset balancing to prepare high-quality training data.

Model Development:
Built an XGBoost model optimized for credit default prediction.
Additionally experimented with Neural Networks and Ensemble Models for comparative analysis.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Conducted extensive tuning using randomized search and cross-validation to improve model performance.

Bias-Variance Analysis:
Analyzed learning curves to evaluate underfitting/overfitting and ensure model generalization.

Interpretability:
Performed SHAP Analysis to understand feature importance and model decision behavior.

Business Strategy:
Proposed a customer selection strategy that maximizes revenue while controlling default risk based on model outputs.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)

XGBoost

Keras / TensorFlow (for Neural Network models)

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

Results
XGBoost outperformed other models with strong predictive power.

SHAP analysis revealed key drivers of credit default risk.

The final model can be used to screen customers effectively based on risk-return trade-offs.
